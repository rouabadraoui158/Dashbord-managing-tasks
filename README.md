# App Description

React application for managing tasks with an interactive dashboard.
The application should:
Display a dashboard with multiple task cards, each representing a task with:
Title
Description
Due date
Priority level (e.g., high, medium, low)
Status (e.g., in progress, completed)
Edit and Delete buttons for each task card.
Include functionality to:
Toggle the visibility of task details (description, due date, priority) within each task card using a "Show/Hide Details" button.
Edit task details (title, description, due date, priority) inline directly within the task card.
Mark tasks as complete or change their status dynamically.
Add new tasks dynamically using a form.
Sort tasks by due date or priority.
Ensure the UI updates dynamically:
Task details should expand or collapse based on their visibility state.
Updated task details should reflect immediately in the UI.
Deleted tasks should be removed from the dashboard.
Instructions:
Utilize useState and useEffect hooks to manage the state of tasks and their details.
Implement advanced conditional rendering to toggle visibility, dynamically update task details, and manage task status.
Design an interactive and visually appealing dashboard layout that enhances task management and user experience.
Implement responsive design principles to ensure the dashboard adapts to different screen sizes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
